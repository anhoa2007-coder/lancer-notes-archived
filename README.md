# lancer-notes
A Markdown notes app that's heavily forked from orginial Lancer Fan Club fourms website.

Project completed by 100% solo with moderate use of AI, templates and inspriations: Taylor Hakes, Gregor Santner and ObjectPresents.

Any feedbacks can go to: @objectpresents (Discord), objectpresents.bsky.social (Bluesky). Email have been removed due to them being fired.

## Changelogs:
#### v2.1.4 (03.11.2025)
- UI consistency improvements across the app:
  - Standardized toolbar buttons to a consistent icon + text pattern.
  - Unified popup title bars with blue headers, close buttons, rounded corners, and consistent shadows.
- Redesigned Find/Replace as a centered dialog with header, improved spacing, and dark-mode support.
- Replaced image cap prompt with a proper Image Cap dialog (validation, persistence, Enter-to-confirm).
- Dark-mode scrollbars across browsers (added color-scheme hints and custom scrollbar styling).
- Bumped application version to v2.1.4.
#### v2.1.3 (29/10/2025)
Features and improvements in v2.1.3:

- Implemented heading rendering inside blockquotes so Markdown headings within ">" blocks render as proper HTML headings.
- Added "image from link" auto-resize option (dialog checkbox). When enabled, the editor measures the linked image client-side and inserts responsive <img> markup with a configurable maximum width (default: 800px). Runtime cap can be adjusted via the toolbar control; preferences are persisted to localStorage (keys: md-auto-resize-images, md-auto-resize-max). Toolbar control id: #btn-image-cap.
- Word wrap (beta) improvements and details:
  - Works in both the editor and the preview. Long words and URLs wrap at safe boundaries to avoid horizontal scrolling.
  - Code blocks use white-space: pre-wrap while preserving indentation; inline code wraps without breaking layout.
  - Blockquotes, lists, and table cells are hardened to wrap content cleanly without overflow.
  - Toggle via toolbar button (#btn-wordwrap) or keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Alt+W / Ctrl+Shift+W).
  - Preference persists in localStorage under md-word-wrap.
  - Credits: feature made by LoserFan2020 with contributions from Phuc and Hung.
- Misc: reordered blockquote/header parsing so headings inside blockquotes render correctly, fixed related JavaScript and CSS syntax issues encountered during development, and applied small UX polish to dialogs and controls.
